Keccak (SHA-3) hash function for PHP
Version 0.2

Keccak (pronounced [kɛtʃak], like “ketchak”) is the hash function that has been
chosen as the winner of NIST's SHA-3 hash algorithm competition. Keccak can be
considered to be a successor of RadioGatún; However, it has a very different
design philosophy.

The author of this extension was in no way involved in the development of the
Keccak hash function itself. The hash source code was taken directly from NIST
submission package with a few minor variable name changes so that it would play
nice with PHP.

See the CREDITS section for more details.
